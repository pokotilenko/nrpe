nagios-nrpe (3.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The bug that caused the SSL support between NRPE 2.x and 3.x not
  to work has been fixed.

  Because the default SSL support without certificates configured
  in nrpe.cfg uses pre-generated key data, configuring SSL
  certificates is strongly advised when STunnel is not used.

  The ssl-cert package can be used to generate a self-signed
  certificate, but CA certificates like those from Let's Encrypt
  are a better choice.

  SSL support has been re-enabled by default, to be better compatible
  with previous NRPE versions where SSL support was enabled by default
  too.

  The check_nrpe command definition has been updated to enable SSL
  support (by removing the -n option) and the check_nrpe_ssl command
  definition has been removed. The previous check_nrpe command
  definition which disables SSL support is available with the new
  check_nrpe_nossl command definition.

nagios-nrpe (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The check_nrpe command definition has been updated to remove the
  arguments option, because nagios-nrpe-server does not support
  command arguments since 2.15-1. And the check_nrpe_1arg command
  definition has been removed.

  If you're using the check_nrpe_1arg command in your Nagios/Icinga
  configuration, you need to replace it with check_nrpe.

  SSL support is disabled by default, the reworked SSL/TLS support in
  NRPE requires configuration before it can be used. Read the
  instructions in /usr/share/doc/nagios-nrpe-server/README.SSL.md.gz
  before enabling SSL support in /etc/default/nagios-nrpe-server.

  The default check_nrpe command in check_nrpe.cfg has been updated
  to disable SSL by default too. The check_nrpe_ssl command has been
  added to connect to the NRPE daemon over SSL.

  Beware that the new NRPE daemon only works with old check_nrpe
  plugins when SSL support is disabled on both sides, likewise the
  new check_nrpe plugin only works with the old NRPE daemon when SSL
  support is disabled.

  To use SSL between the NRPE client and server, configuring Stunnel
  is recommended.

nagios-nrpe (2.15-1) unstable; urgency=high

  This update disables the command-args support in nrpe. The feature
  has several security problems and is often used wrong. If you have to
  use this feature recompile the package with --enable-command-args
  in debian/rules.

nagios-nrpe (2.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The pidfile creation mechanism changed with this update. If you do not 
  add "pid_file=/var/run/nagios/nrpe.pid" to you nrpe config take care that
  the user "nagios" is able to write to your pidfile location. You can also 
  change the initscript to create the pid directory on your own.

nagios-nrpe (2.12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The homedirectory of the nagios user moved to /var/lib/nagios
  which is now common on all nagios related packages. Its recommended
  that you migrate an already existing nagios user to use /var/lib/nagios 
  as homedirectory.

nagios-nrpe (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  the nagios-nrpe-doc package is no longer provided.  the documentation
  can now be found in /usr/share/doc/nagios-nrpe-{server|plugins}.  new
  versions of the plugin and server packages conflict with the doc
  package to prevent the old (and possibly incorrect in the future)
  documentation from remaining.  to fully purge all information about
  the package you should run:
  	dpkg -P nagios-nrpe-doc
