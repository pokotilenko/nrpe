 If you do enable support for command arguments in the NRPE daemon,
-make sure that you encrypt communications either by using:
-
-   1.  Stunnel (see http://www.stunnel.org for more info)
-   2.  Native SSL support (See the [SSL Readme](README.SSL.md) file for more info)
+make sure that you encrypt communications by using, for example,
+Stunnel (see http://www.stunnel.org for more info).
 
 Do **NOT** assume that just because the daemon is behind a firewall
 that you are safe! ***Always encrypt NRPE traffic!***
 
+NOTE: the currently shipped native SSL support of NRPE is not an
+adequante protection, because it does not verify clients and
+server, and uses pregenerated key material. NRPE's SSL option is
+advised against. For more information, see Debian bug #547092.
